# Walder build log

Stage-by-stage record. Each entry: what exists, what was verified, what is deferred.
Written by the orchestrator (Fable) after auditing each builder + reviewer pass.

## 2026-09-08 — Kickoff, live endpoint probe (before M1/M2)

- Project folder created, git initialised, private repo `ViuMP/Walder` created and set as origin.
- **Claude OAuth probe:** Keychain item `Claude Code-credentials` exists with keys
  `accessToken, refreshToken, expiresAt, refreshTokenExpiresAt, scopes, subscriptionType (team), rateLimitTier`.
  The stored access token was EXPIRED; `GET api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` → 401
  `authentication_error: OAuth access token has expired`.
  **Decision:** Walder NEVER refreshes CLI tokens (refresh rotates the token and could invalidate
  Claude Code's own login). Expired token → status `auth-needed` for that provider → fall back to the
  claude.ai web-session provider. The panel shows which source is live.
- **Codex probe:** `~/.codex/auth.json` has `tokens.{access_token, account_id, id_token, refresh_token}`.
  `GET chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` with `Authorization: Bearer` + `ChatGPT-Account-Id` → 200.
  Real shape (fixture saved, identifiers redacted): `rate_limit.primary_window` and
  `rate_limit.secondary_window`, each `{used_percent, limit_window_seconds (18000 / 604800),
  reset_after_seconds, reset_at (unix seconds)}`; plus `plan_type`, `credits`, `model_usage`.
  NOTE: this is the Codex allowance, not necessarily the ChatGPT chat message allowance — M4 must run
  the endpoint-discovery step inside the chatgpt.com login window to find the chat limit endpoint,
  and label the Codex buckets honestly ("Codex 5-hour", "Codex weekly") until then.
- Parser consequence for M2a: `parseChatGptUsage` must handle key `rate_limit` (singular) with
  `primary_window/secondary_window`, `reset_at` as unix seconds, `limit_window_seconds`.

## 2026-09-08 — M2a: scaffold + Electron-free core — ACCEPTED

- **Exists:** electron-vite scaffold (electron 44.2.0, vite 7.3.6, vitest 5, TS 7), placeholder main/preload/renderer,
  `src/core/{buckets,expression,nudge,hittest}.ts`, fixtures + 106 unit tests, `docs/`, `build/` placeholder.
- **Review found (fixed):** ChatGPT parser tested against an invented payload → replaced with the real Codex shape
  (`rate_limit.primary_window/secondary_window`, labels "Codex 5-hour"/"Codex weekly"); relative reset field beat the
  absolute one and drifted every poll → would have re-barked forever; nudge re-arm now needs a >60 s real move;
  Claude fraction auto-detect misread 1 % as 100 % → default is now `percent`; walker no longer reads window lengths as
  percentages; single-instance lock, window-open deny, navigation lock, tight CSP added.
- **Verified by me:** `npm test` 106/106, `typecheck` clean. `postinstall: install-electron` is REQUIRED with
  electron 44 + npm 11 (empirically: without it `npm run dev` dies "Electron uninstall") — do not remove.
- **Deferred:** CSP `connect-src 'none'` blocks Vite HMR websocket in dev (app still runs) → M3 makes the CSP dev-aware.
  `will-navigate` hands http(s) URLs to the OS browser; fine for now.
